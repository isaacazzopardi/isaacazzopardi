            European Parental Alienation Practice (EPAP) is a collaboration between 
            <a href="https://parentalalienation.eu">Parental Alienation Europe</a> 
            and the <a href="www.ift-malta.com">Institute of Family Therapy - Malta</a> 
            to contribute to Parental Alienation. EPAP’s mission is to be a key player 
            in the dissemination of best practices and research through the first ever 
            European-accredited training course in Parental Alienation Studies and its 
            publication, the European Journal of Parental Alienation Practice.

            <br> <br>

            The design for this logo was based on two points that were, in turn,
            the main challenges to overcome. 
            
            <br> <br>
            
            Firstly, the logo has to to visually distill the 
            complex issue that is <em>Parental Alienation</em> into a concise and memorable design.
            
            <br> <br>
            
            Secondly, as EPAP operates in both the fields of psychology and law, 
            the design has to communicate <em>academic rigour</em> as well as <em>professional 
            credibility</em>.

            <br><br>
            
            The only operating context given for this brand was that of a journal publicaiton, for which a 
            secondary logo was designed. Additionally, due to this lack of context for how and where
            EPAP will operate, only traditional mock-ups were produced.

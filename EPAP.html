            EPAP is a collaboration between Parental Alienation Europe and the 
            Institute of Family Therapy Malta to contribute to the field of 
            Parental Alienation. EPAP works towards offering a central reference 
            point for the dissemination of best practices and research in Parental 
            Alienation through our first ever European accredited training course 
            in Parental Alienation Studies and through the publication of the European 
            Journal of Parental Alienation Practice.

            The reference points given at the outset of this project were  a set of 
            keywords and the logo used by Parental Alienation Europe.
        </div>
            <br> <br>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            I chose to focus on the three keywords highlighted: co-parenting, split 
            and loyalties.
            A search for the phrase “Parental Alienation” yielded the selection of 
            images on the right. The images give a general sense of how other people 
            have visually distilled the concept of Parental Alienation, and affirmed
            the chosen keywords.

            Building on the reference images, the starting point was a visual 
            of splitting parents centering around a child.
            We floated the idea of doing this symbolically, by using a universal 
            reference for children. it was suggested that a Teddy Bear could be 
            used as a unisex object. 
            <br> <br>
        </div>
            
        <div class="gallery-text">
            The teddy bear did not work well—its silhouette is too ambiguous and in
            this context it did not yield the desired effect. However, the image 
            of parental split worked well and I decided to develop this further.

    <div class="gallery-container">

            To heighten the split I elongated the silhouettes, which created the 
            possibility of accentuating a direction.
            To replace the teddy bear, I simply made a child's head, which wroked great.

        <div class="gallery-text"> 
            This design felt quite dynamic and highlights the keywords well. There
            is an emphasis on splitting, on loyalties which can be emphasised by 
            the distance between the parents and the the child and on co-parenting,
            when arranged to look towards the same direction.
            My next step was to incorporate the EPAP name with this design.

            Selecting the right typeface came down to choosing between the sans-serif 
            typeface <i>Gotham Narrow</i> and an manually-elongated serif typeface 
            <i>Xahn Mono</i>.
            In the end, a sans-serif typeface complemented the design better, and a boldened
            <i>Gotham Narrow</i> fit it well with the chosen layout. <i>Gotham Narrow</i> is
            quite fascinating with its soft monolithic look, and provides an immediate and 
            memorable look, with great legibility.
            <br><br>
            The decision to use this layout was due to how well it framed the visual emblem 
            with the type, and helped keep it concise and compact. (I was also inspired by 
            Bertold Löffler’s iconic Secession designs.)
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-text">
            By incorporating colour into the design, I wanted to add an emotional context
            and make the design more approachable and memorable. I chose a lighter Iron 
            Blue and a Red Mull; contrasting to accent the difference between the parents
            and the child.
            <br><br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="gallery-text">
            For the Journal version of the logo, I added a stylised 'journal' to the existing 
            logo. This solution was a way to maintain the same identity and incorporate the 
            Journal element and adhere to the goal of being concise.
            <br> 
            I also also created a ‘dark mode’ version, which I thought would help the brand be 
            more dynamic when it comes to different placements.

            In the end, despite really liking the design, I felt insecure about presenting 
            this bold (and probably unusual) design, so I decided to also include what I 
            think is a more orthodox alternartive.
            This design is more compact and I think would have better legibility in different
            contexts.

            Branding for European Parental Alienation Practice, placed on letterhead and envelope.

        <div class="gallery-text">
            One of the issues I had was a lack of context as to how and where the logo will
            be used, except for the journal (even then I don't know if it will be published 
            in print or digitally). The assumption is that this is primarily for digital use. 
            Nonetheless, I made the conservative choice of placing the logos on a letterhead 
            and envelope combo.
        </div>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            As this design hasn't yet been presented (as of July 2022), I expect there to be
            some changes to the life the logo will take and to the logo itself before being 
            finalised.

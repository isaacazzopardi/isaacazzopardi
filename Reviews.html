                <p>I concieved Artsieve in late 2016, as an arts criticism platform focussing on visual arts, music, theatre and other participating art froms in the Maltese cultural scene.</p>
                <p>ArtSieve was created partially to address the general lack of art criticism in Malta, and had hoped to grow the project to include other writers and thinkers. While the project is no longer active since 2018, it can still be found online and is a little bit like a time capsule and a reminder of an ambition I had.</p>
                <p>ArtSieve has been contributed to by <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/author/68">Jessica Arena</a>, now a journalist at Allied Newspapers in Malta </p>

                <h1>A short exploration of Lib(r)a</h1>
                <h4>November, 2017</h4>

                <p>Teatru Santwarju presents Lib(r)a, a physical theatre performance conceived and directed by Martina Georgina, who collaborated on the creation of the performance with fellow actors Julia Camilleri and Althea Corlett, and artist Matthew Pandolfino, at Valletta Campus Theatre (VCT) in the Old University Building.</p>
                <p>Although Lib(r)a is not the visceral and raw performance that its predecessor Limbus was, it establishes an aesthetic for Teatru Santwarju as a meditative, gynocentric and starkly assimilated theatre. Its reliance on ambience, beautifully crafted and sparse props, symbolism, and the performer’s physicality, make Teatru Santwarju Malta’s quality physical theatre.</p>
                <p>Lib(r)a accesses themes of femininity, balance and co-existence, weaving in three distinct characters—the Overthinker, the Temptress, and the Soother—into a loose narrative of sorts, that out</p>

                <h1>I lost the war, too.</h1>
                <h4> January, 2017</h4>
                <img src="https://artsieve.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/scan-016.jpg?w=2000&h=1500&crop=1 alt=" height="250px" width="auto">
                <br>
                <p>Visiting We lost the War, I happily realised this is what artistic maturity looks like.</p>
                <p>I was never much into Ryan Falzon’s print work. It felt phlegmatic; distanced and unemotional, as well as muted in its apparent attempt to epitomise some essence of ‘Maltese‘. The punk aesthetic in his printmaking coupled with the subject matter seemed ineffectual in tackling the width and breadth of ‘Maltese‘, or my perception of it.</p>
                <p>But in We lost the War, not only did the medium change but with it so did my perceptions of what Ryan’s art was about. We lost the War is a tour de force in its achieving a powerful analysis of ‘Maltese‘, while managing to maintain a consistency in a style which Ryan has by now made his own. The style is fascinating in its ambiguity: child-like, yet assured and consistent—it isn’t a deficiency on the part of the artist, it is a device he uses for effect. That effect is glimpsed in the subject matter, to best capture and convey ‘Maltese‘.</p>

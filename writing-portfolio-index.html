            <h2>EXPLORING PATRIARCHY THROUGH THE MEN IN SYLVIA PLATH'S <i>THE BELL JAR</i></h2>
            <h4>June, 2016</h4>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-body">
            
            <img src="Bell Jar.jpg" alt="" height="250px">
                    
            <br><br>

            The Bell Jar, and in essence Sylvia Plath, nestle in the arms of the feminist—a tender and catatonic parable of the American mid-century woman, caught between two worlds: the institution of the American family and the liberation of the independent woman, against a background of haunting, cold war politics.
            
            <br><br>

            Plath and The Bell Jar are intrinsic. They cement one another a legacy; Plath’s suicide before the publication of the novel binds The Bell Jar with the roman à clef tradition, which in turn seals the tragedy (a ‘feminist’ tragedy) that is Sylvia Plath’s life. Plath’s suicide in retrospect, becomes the addendum of her novel.
            
            <br><br>

            The novel also nestles in the arms of Cold War politics, particularly the 50s and 60s, whose generations
            which bore artistic achievements that encapsulate the disquieting sense of impalpable fear that pervade Cold War America and Europe. However, many critics have made the mistake of simplifying Plath’s politics in her work, with the likes of Jacqueline Rose arguing that
            in taking Plath out of politics, they have also ‘taken the politics out of Plath’.1 A political education is inevitable, especially as someone, like Sylvia Plath, brought up during the Cold War period both in America and Britain.
            
            <br><br>

            The Cold War era, maybe even McCarthyism, fueled the internalisation of the Other, a rival, unwanted entity. But Plath’s internalisaiton also extended to her gender and her depression—this were the Other within American society at the time.

            <h2>HOW 'BEING BOTH' LEADS TO EFFECTS OF CONTRAST AND AFFINITY IN ALI SMITH'S <i>HOW TO BE BOTH</i></h2>
            <h4>June, 2017</h4>

            But they are not easily separated: once read, the novel is difficult to read the other way round, to ‘unsee’ or ‘unlearn’ the particular sequence in which the novel
            is presented, either Francescho-George or George- Francescho. My novel started with Francescho’s story, which I believe irremediably contextualises George’s story. The latter was read in light of the former, and re-reading it the other way round doesn’t give the same satisfaction of the just-read—the magic is lost.
            
            <br><br>

            This particular experience is interesting, because it allows readers to essentially experience two different stories simply by changing the sequence of events. Experiments with this notion are plenty: within the film industry, for example, re-cutting films in an attempt to pull out a completely different story are a popular way
            to explore the medium for story potential (a popular example is Nerdwriter’s Passenger, Rearranged
            on YouTube). Smith’s novel explicitly offers us the potential of multiple stories herself, while using the format to address themes of seeing, art, history, queer and feminism, amongst others.
            
            <br><br>

            The two stories make the novel itself a container of ‘both’: its stories are symbiotic and autonomous, interdependent and independent, but it all depends on how they are read: ‘And which comes first? her unbearable mother is saying. What we see or how we see it?’

            <br><br>

            This is a crucial point for the novel—seeing is never as straightforward as we might think.

            Factoring into this are the Crusades, which by the
            13th century were coming to a close with the Fourth Crusade. The Sack of Constantinople, in 1204, was as much a cause for destruction of old artefacts (including the Imperial Library of Constantinople, the last of the great libraries of the ancient world); it has to be assumed that a lot of what wasn’t destroyed was shipped off to Europe as treasure, loot, prizes, gifts, merchandise.
            The Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade were in fact
            the Republic of Venice, the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of France—all were in for rapid cultural upheaval and artistic refinement. Gothic emerging from the Kingdom of France, and spreading across Europe,
            notably the holy Roman Empire, was surely influenced by this migration of sacked good and knowledge.
                    
            <br><br>

            Another important social facet to consider during
            the Medieval period is that Medieval Europe was a
            very buys places when it came to travelling. Most of
            the Gothic in Northern Europe was ‘imported’ from France—the spread of new styles from kingdom to empire was mostly conducted by travellers, merchants, pilgrims, scholars, etc. Travelling during these times was very common, especially with pilgrimages, of which many Gothic cathedrals were the destination, and merchants peddling goods across Europe.

            I concieved Artsieve in late 2016, as an arts criticism platform focussing on visual arts, music, theatre and other participating art froms in the Maltese cultural scene.

            <br><br>

            ArtSieve was created partially to address the general lack of art criticism in Malta, and had hoped to grow the project to include other writers and thinkers. While the project is no longer active since 2018, it can still be found online and is a little bit like a time capsule and a reminder of an ambition I had.

            Teatru Santwarju presents Lib(r)a, a physical theatre performance conceived and directed by Martina Georgina, who collaborated on the creation of the performance with fellow actors Julia Camilleri and Althea Corlett, and artist Matthew Pandolfino, at Valletta Campus Theatre (VCT) in the Old University Building.            
            
            <br><br>

            Although Lib(r)a is not the visceral and raw performance that its predecessor Limbus was, it establishes an aesthetic for Teatru Santwarju as a meditative, gynocentric and starkly assimilated theatre. Its reliance on ambience, beautifully crafted and sparse props, symbolism, and the performer’s physicality, make Teatru Santwarju Malta’s quality physical theatre.

            <br><br>

            Lib(r)a accesses themes of femininity, balance and co-existence, weaving in three distinct characters—the Overthinker, the Temptress, and the Soother—into a loose narrative of sorts, that out</p>

            <h2>I LOST THE WAR, TOO</h2>
            <h4>January, 2017</h4>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-body">
            
            <img src="https://artsieve.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/scan-016.jpg?w=2000&h=1500&crop=1 alt=" height="250px" width="auto">
                    
            <br><br>

            Visiting We lost the War, I happily realised this is what artistic maturity looks like.
              
            <br><br>

            I was never much into Ryan Falzon’s print work. It felt phlegmatic; distanced and unemotional, as well as muted in its apparent attempt to epitomise some essence of ‘Maltese‘. The punk aesthetic in his printmaking coupled with the subject matter seemed ineffectual in tackling the width and breadth of ‘Maltese‘, or my perception of it.
            
            <br><br>

            But in We lost the War, not only did the medium change but with it so did my perceptions of what Ryan’s art was about. We lost the War is a tour de force in its achieving a powerful analysis of ‘Maltese‘, while managing to maintain a consistency in a style which Ryan has by now made his own. 
            The style is fascinating in its ambiguity: child-like, yet assured and consistent—it isn’t a deficiency on the part of the artist, it is a device he uses for effect. That effect is glimpsed in the subject matter, to best capture and convey ‘Maltese‘.

            here&now will encompass themes from political commentary, to evaluations of space; from playful dismantling of intuitive processes to sex. There is queer art, digital art, minimalist art, spatialism, protest art, identity politics and neurology. It is a fitting array for a country going through so many changes.

            <br><br>

            Malta’s socio-political, cultural and actual landscapes are going through considerable transformation. It is more than evident in the news, the stories or simply in living everyday life. In the din of our little island, amplified by social media and news portals, people grumble to the sway of the media.
                                        
            <br><br>

            It can feel overwhelming, frustrating and dismaying, and yet it all seems to wash over us; we have grown accus- tomed to living in a progressively urbanised space, constantly in flux, as internationalised as our consumeristic diet, as umbilical as close family.

            <br><br>

            Artists:
            
            <br><br>
                
            <u>Matthew Attard</u> (b.1987) is a Digital Arts MA by research graduate, based in Malta. His interest in the body and the visual saturation in which it exists in the virtual world, led his practice to explore the re-invention of recognising the body. With an active interest in the neurological role of the viewer’s ability of recognition, his sculptural work engages the cerebral through manipulating both the physical and the subject’s context.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Maxine Attard</u> (b.1986) is a University of Brighton graduate, with an MA in Fine Arts, and is based in Gozo. Her studio practice revolves around ritual and repetition, and are as much about introspection and self-analysis as they are about form and composition.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Aaron Bezzina</u> (b.1991) is an MFA graduate in Digital Arts at University of Malta. His practice revolves around ambiguous, somber and raw interpretations of sculptural in-between objects that defy expectations of function and belief. Since graduating, he has exhibited steadily both in Malta and overseas, including the Venice Biennale.
            
            <br><br>
            
            <u>Kane Cali</u> (b.1983) is an RCA graduate, specialising in glass and ceramics. Based in Valletta, Malta, his studio practice explores the relationship between physical manifestation and technology, through cutting-edge technology, 3D scanning and software, which are rendered in glass and ceramics.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Ryan Falzon</u> (b.1988) is an MCAST graduate in Fine Arts. Based in Żurrieq, Malta, his studio practice revolves around the Maltese character and political milieu. His work is self-described as that of a resistance activist who engages in commentary and criticism of the socio-political landscape of Malta.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Matyou Galea</u> (b.1986) is a PhD graduate in Digital Arts at the University of Malta, and is based in Malta. A fascination with the mechanical and sound fed into his practice, where he strives to connect the visual, the sonic and the object to create sculptural works, or as he calls them 'structures'.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Roxman Gatt</u> (b.1989) is an MA graduate from the Royal College of Art and is based in London. The work is defined by a multi-media approach, where sexuality, identity, gender and consumption are often the main themes explored.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Patrick Mifsud</u> (b.1984) is an MA Graduate in Fine Arts at the University of the Arts London (Wimbledon College of Arts), where he is now based. By intersecting architecture into his work, he creates symbiotic relationships between landscape and site specificity. Space, and our relationship with it, is at the heart of his work, both sculptural and two dimensional.
            
            <br><br>

            <u>Teresa Sciberras</u> (b.1979) is reading for an MFA at the University of Malta and MONASH University in Melbourne, and is based in Malta. Working mainly in painting, drawing and collage, she draws inspiration from the Early Renasissance, structures and atmospheric worlds of magical realism. Her work enquires about intersections, bridging together different structures in order to examine their relationship.

            <h2>ONE DAY
            IN VIENNA</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>published on The Malta Independent
                <br>
                August, 2016</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="article-body">
            In Vienna, standing in front of the Austrian 
            parliament, I thought about history - it is 
            an excellent place to. Out of the street it 
            stands on, the wily hands of time have 
            conspired to change the world. Completed in 
            1883, the Austrian parliament was modelled 
            on Greek buildings from the Athenian Acropolis, 
            effectively establishing a connection with a 
            line of great civilisations and the ideal of 
            democracy.
            <br> <br>
            Not being aware of these things won’t impede 
            you from enjoying the city; Vienna is a 
            staggering medley of beautiful architecture, 
            museums and cathedrals, streets and parks; 
            countless things to see, do and explore, as 
            well as restaurants, cafés and places to 
            leisure about. Vienna is European heartland 
            and I found it to be gorgeous. Admittedly, 
            I am a very casual tourist, I plan nothing 
            other than museums and set out to explore 
            on foot to look for them, allowing myself 
            an erratic route and time to explore anything 
            interesting I encounter.
            <br> <br>
            Although Vienna is a big city, the main 
            attractions are built around the Inner 
            Stadt, notably the Ringstrasse, built 
            to replace the old city walls in the 
            1850s. It was a project that embraced 
            city progress and along this street 
            were built some of the most impressive 
            modern edifices of the day. Today this
            street is a great monument to the 
            cultural and political affluence of 
            9th century Vienna.

            <br> <br>

            <br> <br>

            My hotel was behind Rathausplatz, the Viennese city hall, a magnificent Neo-gothic edifice of spectacular proportions, with a big park in front of it looking like its porch, on the Ringstrasse. Walking about the neighbourhood, and knowing certain information about the city I was trying to piece together the bits and pieces, and soon acquainted myself.
            <br> <br>
            And here I was walking along the Ringstrasse. The Parliament stood to the left of the  Rathausplatz, opposite  the Burgtheater, a statue-rich theatre from 1888, whose staircases were painted by Gustav Klimt. Next to this is the Heldenplatz, Hero Square, the imperial square that is overlooked magisterially by part of the Hofburg Palace, with its imposing facade and equally imposing horseback statue of Archduke Charles keeping vigil.

            Across the Ringstrasse from Heldenplatz are two identical buildings, the imperial museums: the Kunsthistoriches and the Naturhistoriches Museums, Art History and Natural History Museums. They are symmetrical, opposite each other across Maria-Theresien Square (Marie-Antoinette) and standing as showcases of national wealth. The Kunsthistoriches was the first museum I planned to visit - on the inside, a tremendously eye-dazzling place: 
                marble and gold, laid out in intricate Rococo style filling the interior, along with beautifully painted ceilings and arches, some, again, by Gustave Klimt. The collection of art inside is astounding - one of the world's best and biggest painting collection, as well as sculpture, artefacts, armoury, devotional reliquaries, paraphernalia and other odd bits and pieces of ivory carving, gold and precious gems - literally dazzling.

            Beyond Maria-Theresian Platz is the Museums' Quartier, a big complex that houses the Leopold Museum, my next destination, as well as Mumok, Kunsthalle Wien, Architektur Centrum Wien and ZoomKindmuseum, along with a number of eateries and cafes and leisure areas. It is generally a great place to hang out and potentially spend a day or two exploring all of the Quarter.

            The Leopold Museum is home to over 5,000 works of modern Austrian art - Egon Schiele, Gustave Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Richard Gerstl. Apart from personally being a big fan of Schiele's work, this collection is phenomenal and a true Austrian national treasure.

            Back to walking along the Ringstrasse, one encounters an opera house, the world-famous Wiener Staatsoper, where major productions are put up. But I was looking for the Albertina, just up the road to the left of Staatsoper. The Albertina is an art museum whose collection focuses mostly on prints. They have an astounding one million old master prints, as well as about 65,000 drawings, along with other collections of impressionist and modern art. Famously the museum owns the prints and drawings of Da Vinci, Dürer, Bruegel the Elder, Fragonard, Monet and other giants from art.

            For the last museum destination I decided to get a taxi, more for issues of time than anything (I walked it back to the hotel, and it was quite a nice walk). The Belvedere is the most beautiful place you'll visit in Vienna. Having been the summer residence of the Habsburgs, the palace sits on a hill overlooking Vienna, hence Belvedere - with its extensive grounds, it makes for a lovely stroll. Although it has been engulfed in the growing city, it used to be on the outskirts with virgin land all around it. Inside, the museum houses a collection that presents an almost complete overview of Austrian art and thus an insight into Austrian history, from Medieval to Baroque to Modernist works of art.

            I wrapped up most of my days with a restaurant visit at Café Français on Roosevelt Platz, following a suggestion by a friend - it does have amazing food. A special restaurant I tried was Do&Co on Stephenplatz, up high over the square, level with the magnificent cathedral. Having tried the famous Austrian schnitzel (pounded meat made very thin, coated with bread crumbs and fried) at a kiosk, I decided to try it at this five-star restaurant, much to my delight. Other Viennese treats include the infamous (but much-loved) hot dog stand outside the Albertina Museum and the mouth-watering Sachertorte of which you can only have enough when you pass out. I tried it at the hotel opened by the man whose father invented the Sachertorte, the Hotel Sacher Café.
            <br>
            The food is reason enough to re-visit Vienna, let alone the myriad of museums and constant bombarding of opulence and grandiose architecture.

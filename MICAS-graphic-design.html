            <br>
            <br>
            The <a href="https://micas.art">MICAS</a> Summer Celebration, held in the summer of 2019, consisted of a 
            talk by curator Edith Devaney (<i>Artists & their Archives</i>) and a 
            video projection of JUMPSTART, a projection of the history of Maltese 
            contemporary art.

            1. The projection was created externally and finalised at the last minute, 
            meaning there were no visuals to align with. Conseqently, it made unclear  
            which activity was the focus of the event.

        <div id="text-challenges-2"><br><br>2. Using colour. MICAS stakeholders were often 
            reluctant to use colour in event visuals, but given the title, it seemed remiss 
            not to incorporate some colour in the design.

            The MICAS branding guidelines were made by the same design agency that
            designed the MICAS logo. They defined six colours as part of these 
            branding guidelines, along with two typefaces: <i>Euclid Flex</i> 
            and <i>Arial</i>.
        </div>
            <br> <br>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            Despite the branding colours, MICAS stakeholders were regularly reluctant to use 
            colour in event visuals—given the event's name (<i>Summer Celebration!</i>)
            I wanted to find a compromise.
        </div>
            <br> <br>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            Through the preliminary experiments I wanted to establish how I 
            could use colour. Despite the results being inadequate, these helped me 
            establish what colours  to use and that <i>Euclid Flex</i> might not be 
            a suitable typeface for this project.

            The most pertinent information was the branding and the date, and these 
            came together as simple lower-case text. A lower-case font in the lighter 
            orange were consistent with the simple designs of previous events, but 
            I found the <i>Euclid Flex</i> problematic.

            <i>Euclid Flex</i> has been tricky to work with for me. A substitue I had used 
            previously is <i>HK Grotesk</i>, which complements the MICAS branding
            well and complements the 'summery-ness' of the orange.

            The JUMPSTART project was undertaken by academic stakeholders of MICAS to build 
            an archive of Contemporary Art history in Malta, which meant I had access to a lot 
            of images.

            <br> <br>
        <div class="gallery-text"> 
            These images constituted the visual elements of the timeline projection itself 
            and the prima materia of the project—since I did not have access to any 
            visuals of the JUMPSTART projection I couldn't align my visuals with it, 
            and incoroporating the archive images was the safest way forward.

            <br> <br>
        <div class="gallery-text">
            The answer to incorporating the images in the design proved straightforward
            but it took me a while to get to it. This 'timeline' design of the iamges 
            proved an effective way to link the idea of the timeline projection and the
            'archival' nature of the project, was liked by the stakeholders, and 
            importantly, worked well when incorporated within the designs produced for print.

            <small id="PS"><b>PS</b>: MICAS hires a design agency for most of its design needs. 
                As an only in-house designer, more often than not, my role is to fix 
                any fix brief shortcomings, missing visuals from the agency, or on-the-fly 
                needs, and usualy have to adhere to existing designs, and without any 
                guidance from the agency (it falls outside their remit).
                This is the only project that I designed in full at MICAS—sadly, after 
                4 years, I realised the role has not been conducive to me developing 
                good design practices or a consistent portfolio, albeit having a lot 
                of freedom to learn and experiment.

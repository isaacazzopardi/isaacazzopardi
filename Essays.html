                <p>Factoring into this are the Crusades, which by the
                    13th century were coming to a close with the Fourth Crusade. The Sack of Constantinople, in 1204, was as much a cause for destruction of old artefacts (including the Imperial Library of Constantinople, the last of the great libraries of the ancient world); it has to be assumed that a lot of what wasn’t destroyed was shipped off to Europe as treasure, loot, prizes, gifts, merchandise.
                    The Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade were in fact
                    the Republic of Venice, the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of France—all were in for rapid cultural upheaval and artistic refinement. Gothic emerging from the Kingdom of France, and spreading across Europe,
                    notably the holy Roman Empire, was surely influenced by this migration of sacked good and knowledge.</p>
                <p>Another important social facet to consider during
                    the Medieval period is that Medieval Europe was a
                    very buys places when it came to travelling. Most of
                    the Gothic in Northern Europe was ‘imported’ from France—the spread of new styles from kingdom to empire was mostly conducted by travellers, merchants, pilgrims, scholars, etc. Travelling during these times was very common, especially with pilgrimages, of which many Gothic cathedrals were the destination, and merchants peddling goods across Europe.</p>

                <h1>Exploring patriarchy through the men in Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar</h1>

                <p>The Bell Jar, and in essence Sylvia Plath, nestle in the arms of the feminist—a tender and catatonic parable of the American mid-century woman, caught between two worlds: the institution of the American family and the liberation of the independent woman, against a background of haunting, cold war politics.</p>
                <p>Plath and The Bell Jar are intrinsic. They cement one another a legacy; Plath’s suicide before the publication of the novel binds The Bell Jar with the roman à clef tradition, which in turn seals the tragedy (a ‘feminist’ tragedy) that is Sylvia Plath’s life. Plath’s suicide in retrospect, becomes the addendum of her novel.</p>
                <p>The novel also nestles in the arms of Cold War politics, particularly the 50s and 60s, whose generations
                    which bore artistic achievements that encapsulate the disquieting sense of impalpable fear that pervade Cold War America and Europe. However, many critics have made the mistake of simplifying Plath’s politics in her work, with the likes of Jacqueline Rose arguing that
                    in taking Plath out of politics, they have also ‘taken the politics out of Plath’.1 A political education is inevitable, especially as someone, like Sylvia Plath, brought up during the Cold War period both in America and Britain.</p>
                    <p>The Cold War era, maybe even McCarthyism, fueled the internalisation of the Other, a rival, unwanted entity. But Plath’s internalisaiton also extended to her gender and her depression—this were the Other within American society at the time.</p>

                <h1>How ‘being both’ leads to effects of contrast and affinity in Ali Smith’s How to be Both.</h1>
                <h4>June, 2017</h4>

                <p>But they are not easily separated: once read, the novel is difficult to read the other way round, to ‘unsee’ or ‘unlearn’ the particular sequence in which the novel
                    is presented, either Francescho-George or George- Francescho. My novel started with Francescho’s story, which I believe irremediably contextualises George’s story. The latter was read in light of the former, and re-reading it the other way round doesn’t give the same satisfaction of the just-read—the magic is lost.</p>
                <p>This particular experience is interesting, because it allows readers to essentially experience two different stories simply by changing the sequence of events. Experiments with this notion are plenty: within the film industry, for example, re-cutting films in an attempt to pull out a completely different story are a popular way
                    to explore the medium for story potential (a popular example is Nerdwriter’s Passenger, Rearranged
                    on YouTube). Smith’s novel explicitly offers us the potential of multiple stories herself, while using the format to address themes of seeing, art, history, queer and feminism, amongst others.</p>
                <p>The two stories make the novel itself a container
                    of ‘both’: its stories are symbiotic and autonomous, interdependent and independent, but it all depends on how they are read: ‘And which comes first? her unbearable mother is saying. What we see or how we see it?’</p>
                <p>This is a crucial point for the novel—seeing is never as straightforward as we might think.</p>

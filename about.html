            A mostly self-taught designer, I have spent my formal education in 
            arts and humanities. Throughout the years I gravitated to design 
            again and again, through freelance jobs and personal projects.

            <br><br>

            My current goal is to find design-focussed roles in design studios 
            to gain more experience in design process, typography and all-round 
            becoming a better designer.

            <br><br>

            Most of my learning was through doing. This website is one such project, 
            which I coded from scratch using Visual Studio Code and hosted on Github. 
            It follows many failed websites and attempts.Over the pandemic I taught 
            myself HTML & CSS and in 2021 I started dabbling in UI/UX, and Figma.
            
            <br><br>
            
            I am happy to assist with any project, so feel free to get in touch 
            if you think I may be useful to you!-->

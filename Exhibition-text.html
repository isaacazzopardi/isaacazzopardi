                <h1>Valletta Contemporary</h1>
                <h4>June, 2018</h4>
                <section><img src="VC Here&Now1.png" alt="Valletta Contemporary show image showing Aaron Bezzina and Ryan Falzon art pieces installed in gallery" height="250px"></section>
                <p>here&now will encompass themes from political commentary, to evaluations of space; from playful dismantling of intuitive processes to sex. There is queer art, digital art, minimalist art, spatialism, protest art, identity politics and neurology. It is a fitting array for a country going through so many changes.</p>
                <p>Malta’s socio-political, cultural and actual landscapes are going through considerable transformation. It is more than evident in the news, the stories or simply in living everyday life. In the din of our little island, amplified by social media and news portals, people grumble to the sway of the media.</p>
                <p>It can feel overwhelming, frustrating and dismaying, and yet it all seems to wash over us; we have grown accus- tomed to living in a progressively urbanised space, constantly in flux, as internationalised as our consumeristic diet, as umbilical as close family.</p>
                <p>Artists:</p>
                <p><u>Matthew Attard</u> (b.1987) is a Digital Arts MA by research graduate, based in Malta. His interest in the body and the visual saturation in which it exists in the virtual world, led his practice to explore the re-invention of recognising the body. With an active interest in the neurological role of the viewer’s ability of recognition, his sculptural work engages the cerebral through manipulating both the physical and the subject’s context.</p>
                <p><u>Maxine Attard</u> (b.1986) is a University of Brighton graduate, with an MA in Fine Arts, and is based in Gozo. Her studio practice revolves around ritual and repetition, and are as much about introspection and self-analysis as they are about form and composition.</p>
                <p><u>Aaron Bezzina</u> (b.1991) is an MFA graduate in Digital Arts at University of Malta. His practice revolves around ambiguous, somber and raw interpretations of sculptural in-between objects that defy expectations of function and belief. Since graduating, he has exhibited steadily both in Malta and overseas, including the Venice Biennale.</p>
                <p><u>Kane Cali</u> (b.1983) is an RCA graduate, specialising in glass and ceramics. Based in Valletta, Malta, his studio practice explores the relationship between physical manifestation and technology, through cutting-edge technology, 3D scanning and software, which are rendered in glass and ceramics.</p>
                <p><u>Ryan Falzon</u> (b.1988) is an MCAST graduate in Fine Arts. Based in Żurrieq, Malta, his studio practice revolves around the Maltese character and political milieu. His work is self-described as that of a resistance activist who engages in commentary and criticism of the socio-political landscape of Malta.</p>
                <p><u>Matyou Galea</u> (b.1986) is a PhD graduate in Digital Arts at the University of Malta, and is based in Malta. A fascination with the mechanical and sound fed into his practice, where he strives to connect the visual, the sonic and the object to create sculptural works, or as he calls them 'structures'.</p>
                <p><u>Roxman Gatt</u> (b.1989) is an MA graduate from the Royal College of Art and is based in London. The work is defined by a multi-media approach, where sexuality, identity, gender and consumption are often the main themes explored.</p>
                <p><u>Patrick Mifsud</u> (b.1984) is an MA Graduate in Fine Arts at the University of the Arts London (Wimbledon College of Arts), where he is now based. By intersecting architecture into his work, he creates symbiotic relationships between landscape and site specificity. Space, and our relationship with it, is at the heart of his work, both sculptural and two dimensional.</p>
                <p><u>Teresa Sciberras</u> (b.1979) is reading for an MFA at the University of Malta and MONASH University in Melbourne, and is based in Malta. Working mainly in painting, drawing and collage, she draws inspiration from the Early Renasissance, structures and atmospheric worlds of magical realism. Her work enquires about intersections, bridging together different structures in order to examine their relationship.</p>

                    <h2>One day in Vienna</h2>
                    <h4>August, 2016</h4>
                    <p>In Vienna, standing in front of the Austrian 
                    parliament, I thought about history - it is 
                    an excellent place to. Out of the street it 
                    stands on, the wily hands of time have 
                    conspired to change the world. Completed in 
                    1883, the Austrian parliament was modelled 
                    on Greek buildings from the Athenian Acropolis, 
                    effectively establishing a connection with a 
                    line of great civilisations and the ideal of 
                    democracy.</p>
                    <p>Not being aware of these things won’t impede 
                    you from enjoying the city; Vienna is a 
                    staggering medley of beautiful architecture, 
                    museums and cathedrals, streets and parks; 
                    countless things to see, do and explore, as 
                    well as restaurants, cafés and places to 
                    leisure about. Vienna is European heartland 
                    and I found it to be gorgeous. Admittedly, 
                    I am a very casual tourist, I plan nothing 
                    other than museums and set out to explore 
                    on foot to look for them, allowing myself 
                    an erratic route and time to explore anything 
                    interesting I encounter.</p>
                    <p>Although Vienna is a big city, the main 
                    attractions are built around the Inner 
                    Stadt, notably the Ringstrasse, built 
                    to replace the old city walls in the 
                    1850s. It was a project that embraced 
                    city progress and along this street 
                    were built some of the most impressive 
                    modern edifices of the day. Today this
                    street is a great monument to the 
                    cultural and political affluence of 
                    9th century Vienna.</p>

                    <p>My hotel was behind Rathausplatz, the Viennese city hall, a magnificent Neo-gothic edifice of spectacular proportions, with a big park in front of it looking like its porch, on the Ringstrasse. Walking about the neighbourhood, and knowing certain information about the city I was trying to piece together the bits and pieces, and soon acquainted myself.</p>
                    <p>And here I was walking along the Ringstrasse. The Parliament stood to the left of the  Rathausplatz, opposite  the Burgtheater, a statue-rich theatre from 1888, whose staircases were painted by Gustav Klimt. Next to this is the Heldenplatz, Hero Square, the imperial square that is overlooked magisterially by part of the Hofburg Palace, with its imposing facade and equally imposing horseback statue of Archduke Charles keeping vigil.</p>
                    <p>Across the Ringstrasse from Heldenplatz are two identical buildings, the imperial museums: the Kunsthistoriches and the Naturhistoriches Museums, Art History and Natural History Museums. They are symmetrical, opposite each other across Maria-Theresien Square (Marie-Antoinette) and standing as showcases of national wealth. The Kunsthistoriches was the first museum I planned to visit - on the inside, a tremendously eye-dazzling place: 
                        marble and gold, laid out in intricate Rococo style filling the interior, along with beautifully painted ceilings and arches, some, again, by Gustave Klimt. The collection of art inside is astounding - one of the world's best and biggest painting collection, as well as sculpture, artefacts, armoury, devotional reliquaries, paraphernalia and other odd bits and pieces of ivory carving, gold and precious gems - literally dazzling.</p>
                    <p>Beyond Maria-Theresian Platz is the Museums' Quartier, a big complex that houses the Leopold Museum, my next destination, as well as Mumok, Kunsthalle Wien, Architektur Centrum Wien and ZoomKindmuseum, along with a number of eateries and cafes and leisure areas. It is generally a great place to hang out and potentially spend a day or two exploring all of the Quarter.</p>
                    
                    <section><img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=130443" height="250px"><img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=130444" height="250px"></section>        
                    
                    <p>The Leopold Museum is home to over 5,000 works of modern Austrian art - Egon Schiele, Gustave Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Richard Gerstl. Apart from personally being a big fan of Schiele's work, this collection is phenomenal and a true Austrian national treasure.</p>
                    <p>Back to walking along the Ringstrasse, one encounters an opera house, the world-famous Wiener Staatsoper, where major productions are put up. But I was looking for the Albertina, just up the road to the left of Staatsoper. The Albertina is an art museum whose collection focuses mostly on prints. They have an astounding one million old master prints, as well as about 65,000 drawings, along with other collections of impressionist and modern art. Famously the museum owns the prints and drawings of Da Vinci, Dürer, Bruegel the Elder, Fragonard, Monet and other giants from art.</p>
                    <p>For the last museum destination I decided to get a taxi, more for issues of time than anything (I walked it back to the hotel, and it was quite a nice walk). The Belvedere is the most beautiful place you'll visit in Vienna. Having been the summer residence of the Habsburgs, the palace sits on a hill overlooking Vienna, hence Belvedere - with its extensive grounds, it makes for a lovely stroll. Although it has been engulfed in the growing city, it used to be on the outskirts with virgin land all around it. Inside, the museum houses a collection that presents an almost complete overview of Austrian art and thus an insight into Austrian history, from Medieval to Baroque to Modernist works of art.</p>
                    <p>I wrapped up most of my days with a restaurant visit at Café Français on Roosevelt Platz, following a suggestion by a friend - it does have amazing food. A special restaurant I tried was Do&Co on Stephenplatz, up high over the square, level with the magnificent cathedral. Having tried the famous Austrian schnitzel (pounded meat made very thin, coated with bread crumbs and fried) at a kiosk, I decided to try it at this five-star restaurant, much to my delight. Other Viennese treats include the infamous (but much-loved) hot dog stand outside the Albertina Museum and the mouth-watering Sachertorte of which you can only have enough when you pass out. I tried it at the hotel opened by the man whose father invented the Sachertorte, the Hotel Sacher Café.</p>
                    <p>The food is reason enough to re-visit Vienna, let alone the myriad of museums and constant bombarding of opulence and grandiose architecture.</p>

                    <h2>Trees: An inspiration we need to protect</h2>
                    <h4>August, 2016</h4>
                    <section><img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=167794&width=630&height=340" alt="painting of trees form Roman period and a Gustav Klimt painting of trees" height="250px"></section>
                    <p>Growing up playing amid southern countryside has put in me a fascination of sorts for the rugged, haphazardly sectioned Maltese countryside. I thought of the fields as a 'beyond' - with their rubble walls, their elusive, seasonal ponds of tadpoles, their terrible wasp nests. Some - guarded by wall, dog or hunter - were impossible to get into, and remain undefined and tempting to this day.</p>
                    <p>In this countryside, however, there was one thing most enchanting and curious - the trees. I went out to the fields to climb trees, and spent a lot of time up on some leafy perch. Now that I'm in my early twenties (and very much still a child), I look back fondly on those moments, because they helped me establish an intimacy with nature.</p>
                    <p>Whenever I tell someone that I used to climb trees as a young boy, most tease me, drawing obvious comparisons to monkeys. I find this reaction utterly perplexing - to me the trees were like attractions in a playground. Predictably, I became more and more defensive of trees and nature in general.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=167795" alt="Vincent van Gogh, Mulberry Tree, 1889" height="250px"><figcaption>Vincent van Gogh, Mulberry Tree, 1889</figcaption>
                    
                    <p>Everyone knows the benefit of trees: they clean the air, especially our car-infested air; they protect the soil and the water; provide shade and cool air in our ever-hot summer months; and they provide shelter and habitat to our (albeit non-existent) fauna. Maybe not everyone knows that trees and greenery are beneficial to mental health - they reduce stress levels, increase rehabilitation success rates, and aids concentration. Studies show that businesses with more natural elements do better compared to those without.</p>
                    <p>An education that fostered my views on environmental issues was arts school and looking at lots of pictures of nature and trees. It's quite possible that the most heavily depicted subject throughout the history of art, apart from people (and locally Mdina), is trees.</p>
                    <p>n old, recurring depiction, for example, is that of the 'Tree of Life' and it is no poetic, fantastical creation - trees benefitted humans since we can remember. Egyptian, Greek, Norse and Indian mythologies have trees of knowledge and power and cosmic grandeur. Buddha was enlightened under an ancient fig tree. Modern fiction has great trees too - in Harry Potter and Tolkien's fantasy, even Game of Thrones.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=167796" alt="David Hockney, Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique, 2007" height="auto" width="500px"><figcaption>David Hockney, Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique, 2007</figcaption>
                    
                    <p>For the poetic and fantastical, but nonetheless true: trees have been towers for lookouts; a bed for lovers; gallows for hanging men; hideouts for the escaped; a respite for the chased. For me, confronting images as Klimt's Buchenwald I or Van Gogh's Mulberry Tree it is difficult to not feel some magic or allure. They exude a certain energy - Klimt loved painting the trees during his summer retreats in the forest, and Van Gogh wrote to his brother that this particular mulberry tree was his favourite in the asylum garden.</p>
                    <p>Before them the Romantics paid homage to the Tree, an almostsentient warden of nature beckoning the traveller forth to witness the immensity of nature. Later Manet would put the sexual freedom and voyeurism in the park, while Monet would paint colourful, waltzing trees, and Renoir make trees dance along Parisians in revelry.</p>
                    <p>Hockney's contemporary sycamore-and-beech painting series assert their looming majestic presence, dwarfing the buildings to the right. They speak grandeur, almost temple-esque, on par with Grecian deity statues, as if royalty on a theatrical stage (a remnant of Hockney's work in stage design). To me, this is reminiscent of the beautiful tree flanking Mdina gate, looking as old as time, or the trees that have become one with the ruined gates of the Cottonera lines, or the high looming rows of ficus trees found all over the island.</p>
                    <p>So when I'm confronted with the tearing down of trees in Malta, I wonder why trees are so indispensable to Maltese. Are decades old trees indispensable, or worth tearing down in the name of 'better' infrastructure? Are trees really the problem with our infrastructure? Do they even factor in? Has no one thought of aesthetic and contrast and shade and a little allure, or at least compromise? Does everyone have oh-so-many important things that no one stops and looks at a nature? How a tree catches the light or is framed by beautiful yellow bastions? Are we lazy and inconsistent? Or is it just weird me?</p>
                    <p>Especially horrifying is the nonchalance with which some shrug off the removal of trees, with an 'Uwijja, they grow back no?': the same disrespect we so called ultrapatriotic country gut down architectural heritage for brutal, 'modern' concrete apartments, as if secreted out of the foreheads of Minecraft addicted architects.</p>
                    <p>Does no one seriously find it sad that we are so subconsciously obsessed with our concrete blocks that even trees are cut into cubes? If we are so patriotic, so heritage and tradition loving, why do we not look to the most ancient of Maltese art and culture for inspiration - our own Tree of Life?</p>

                    <h1>Red roofs and bicycles: a week in Vilnius</h1>
                    <h4>December, 2015</h4>
                    <p>I landed in twilit Kaunas after a four-hour flight. After another two hours of dismal landscape rushing by in the dark of the night, I alighted in a square overlooked by a looming building I later found out to be the train station.</p>
                    <p>I hauled my tired self and my backpack off the bus and into the cold, brisk air of Vilnius on an October night. I waved away a man asking for cigarettes while messaging the friends I came to visit, 'Come fetch me!' And after fifteen minutes they did.</p>
                    <p>The week I spent in Vilnius was mostly a happy one. I was infatuated with the city: I remember that on the second day I thought to myself, I could come spend next summer here. I didn't, but that was not the point. </p>
                    <p>Vilnius has an interesting history. According to legend a Grand Duke called Gediminas, asleep after a day of hunting, had a dream of an iron wolf howling on top of a hill. Asking a local pagan priest to translate it for him, Gediminas was told that he must build a castle atop the hill, strategically surrounded by three rivers, and a grand city was to flourish around it. And so he did and Vilnius was born. Gediminas issued an open gate policy, established a trade centre, and through with many wars and sieges, and enjoying riches from trade, the city grew.</p>
                    
                    <section><img src="https://www.independent.com.mt/file.aspx?f=117025" alt="a high view of Vilnius city centre" height="auto" width="500px"></section>

                    <p>Going up the high hill towards the now ruined Tower of Gediminas, I was captivated. Not only by the sight of a city cut in two - the low quaint red-tile roofs of the Old town on one side and the spanking new, tall glass buildings to the left - but how impressive of a view it was. The city lay out beneath me, in the rich, colourful detail of a busy place, of people walking to and fro, cars flowing and angles upon angles of buildings.</p>
                    <p>What I enjoyed the most however was cycling around the city. Riding the bike through the Old Town - the biggest and best preserved in Europe - was a thrill. The buildings are so beautiful. You can make out medieval and gothic through to neo-classical; palatial buildings to massive churches and intricate cathedrals. In one church there was the spookiest medieval mural darkened with soot and faint with age, while the St Peter and St Paul Church feels like you've walked into a fluffy Baroque cloud carved out in intricate detail.</p>
                    <p>The special moments however are always reserved for night. Night has something special about it: there's a certain quiet instilled that makes the time more enjoyable. I met some people at a party my friends threw, and a girl invited me for a walk the next day. It was already dark when we met up and it was all surreal, as I was led through small winding streets of crumbly and quaint buildings. We were apparently in a poorer part of the Old Town, a suburb of sorts. We crossed over a stream onto a street that looked like it was photocopied off Montemartre. I spent the night talking with her friends in a one room apartment, after which I was gifted photographs and Lithuanian incense.</p>
                    <p>Nightlife was rich, and although I did not particularly partake in any nightlife, I caught a glimpse of it. The centre was full of teenagers and young adults out with friends, drinking, clubbing, skateboarding, you name it. The bars, drinking holes and clubs were fit to burst and all pleasing, people roaring with laughter and everything was a good cheer. Everything felt perfectly safe and I was assured it was the case.</p>
                    <p>On one day we went out of the city centre. If my memory serves me well, we hitched a fifteen-minute bus ride and walked along a street with thick woods on either side until we arrived at a river. This is were they have their beach. My ignorance of and surprise at the existence of river beaches can be partially excused, seeing as this was my first Northern European city, and my being used to Mediterranean beaches. These beaches were rather big stretches of fine sand along the banks of the river, charmingly ensconced in the trees. Here, I was bemused at finding wooden 'changing booths', picnic tables and benches installed.</p>
                    <p>The stay in Vilnius ended with my forgetting my phone, and having to run back to my friend's apartment, only to panic and forget the pass-code. I ran all the way to the station all embarrassed and ran collectively back to successfully fetch my phone. You only fully appreciate how fast taxis are when you have made everyone lose the bus. We did get to the airport in time, and got onto the flight to London for a reckless weekend of art shows, a Maltese gig and plenty of drink</p>
